Deep Dive PWP

### Milestone 1 Feedback
Based on our earlier meeting about PWP Milestone 1, I don't see any of the refinements that we had discussed. Your Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona all need more detail and clarity. What you have here is not sufficient.

- The **Purpose** should be the overall purpose of your PWP. Since it sounds like you plan to freelance, this should support your business goals. A word of caution: doing a PWP to drive sales to a prospective, rather than existing, freelance business is a difficult task since you will need to create the site to serve business goals. In effect, your business becomes your "client" in this project - and this makes it much more difficult. Perhaps a more general "professional portfolio" may be a better direction for you to take.

- The **Audience** could use more detail.

- The **Goal** you have here doesn't have anything to do with PWP. The Goal here should be the overarching goal of your PWP site, akin to a mission statement.

- The **Persona** here does not have enough detail, and it is not professionally written. It is important to have a very thorough understanding of your site's users so you can design a product for them. Have a look at the sample milestones for guidance (link below).

Please review the Milestone 1 Documentation, UX documentation, and Sample Milestones for guidance:

Your project is set up ok, but there are a few technical points for you to review and fix. We are not building the PWP site in the /documentation directory **and** PWP is only a single  page - so remove the other pages. This is not the approach we'll be taking in this project.  Have a look at Edits &amp; Suggestions below.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/) (Submitted late, within one day of due date/time). Please submit revisions to the content and apply fixes before Wednesday 8:00am and I'll bump your grade to [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

#### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Add `/vendor` to your .gitgignore
- DOCTYPE is mistyped - `html` is missing
- Be careful to indent your HTML properly.
