Deep Dive PWP

### Milestone 1 Feedback
Based on our earlier meeting about PWP Milestone 1, I don't see any of the refinements that we had discussed. Your Purpose, Audience, Goal and Persona all need more detail and clarity. What you have here is not sufficient.

- The **Purpose** should be the overall purpose of your PWP. Since it sounds like you plan to freelance, this should support your business goals. A word of caution: doing a PWP to drive sales to a prospective, rather than existing, freelance business is a difficult task since you will need to create the site to serve business goals. In effect, your business becomes your "client" in this project - and this makes it much more difficult. Perhaps a more general "professional portfolio" may be a better direction for you to take.

- The **Audience** could use more detail.

- The **Goal** you have here doesn't have anything to do with PWP. The Goal here should be the overarching goal of your PWP site, akin to a mission statement.

- The **Persona** here does not have enough detail, and it is not professionally written. It is important to have a very thorough understanding of your site's users so you can design a product for them. Have a look at the sample milestones for guidance (link below).

Please review the Milestone 1 Documentation, UX documentation, and Sample Milestones for guidance:

Your project is set up ok, but there are a few technical points for you to review and fix. We are not building the PWP site in the /documentation directory **and** PWP is only a single  page - so remove the other pages. This is not the approach we'll be taking in this project.  Have a look at Edits &amp; Suggestions below.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/) (Submitted late, within one day of due date/time). Please submit revisions to the content and apply fixes before Wednesday 8:00am and I'll bump your grade to [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

#### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Add `/vendor` to your .gitgignore
- DOCTYPE is mistyped - `html` is missing
- Be careful to indent your HTML properly.

#### Milestone 1 Revision Feedback
The purpose and goal are still not detailed enough, and are not relevant to this project. Please see the [Sample Milestones](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/example/) that I mentioned in the feedback above - that level of detail was the guide for Tier IV (grade A/professional) work - ideally what we were looking for here. The persona and audience are not detailed enough, and what you have here tells me next to nothing about these prospective clients of yours that you're building a site to engage with. There are also numerous spelling and grammatical errors here, which are very unprofessional.  TL; DR: this is not the quality of work you could hand to a client, coworker, or boss, and it's not accurate or detailed enough to provide you with a plan to base development on. If you plan to freelance, the ability to document, plan, and scope a project professionally is very important. That's the primary reason we assign these milestones to begin with - to highlight this process at a beginner level with very simple and basic requirements. In the "real world" of web and software development the requirements will go far beyond this.

The following technical issues listed above were not fixed:
- Your .gitignore is still missing `/vendor`
- Your DOCTYPE is still mistyped
- HTML indentation is still incorrect

Unfortunately, since the documentation you have here is insufficient and does not align with the project outline and the technical errors were not fixed I cannot increase the grade on this project. The grade stands at [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Please begin Milestone 2a ASAP as you do not have time to complete any more work on this phase. Please bear in mind that successful completion of PWP is a graduation requirement.
